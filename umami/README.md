# umami

## Why

Knowing whether anyone reads your site usually means handing every visitor to an analytics company. [Umami](https://umami.is) counts page views without cookies or personal data, and keeps the database on a machine you own.

## What

One process on two hostnames. `umami` is the dashboard, behind `org`. `analytics` serves the tracking script and takes page views, on `none`, because every visitor's browser has to reach it. Both are port `3000` on the place `umami`; list `umami` first so `UMAMI_PORT` is named after it. Postgres runs beside it as `umami-db`.

The `analytics` hostname serves the whole Umami process, so its login page is public too. Umami's own password protects it, which is why Start changes the default password before anything is published.

To use it in a card, copy the `umami` and `umami-db` services, the volume, and the four `UMAMI_` lines in `card.env`, then put the tracking snippet from the dashboard into your site with the `analytics` hostname.

Page views, sites and accounts live in the volume `umami-db-data`. Minimum recommended for the place `umami`: 384 MB of memory and 1.5 GB of disk, on an arm64 or amd64 machine, with no GPU.

The Compose file is [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml), the settings [card.env](card.env), the card [card.yml](card.yml), and the last test [test.yml](test.yml).

## How

Five steps. Edit [card.env](card.env) before you start.

### 1. Fetch

```bash
mkdir -p umami
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Edgible/starters/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz \
  | tar -xz --strip-components=2 -C umami starters-main/umami
```

### 2. Edit card.env

Set `DEVICE` to a name `edgible device list` prints. The three secrets are generated in the next step.

```bash
nano umami/card.env
```

### 3. Check

```bash
curl -fsSLo check-env.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Edgible/card-kit/main/check-env.py
python3 check-env.py umami
```

It fills each empty secret and moves a taken port, as lines to paste. Run it again until it says `no conflicts`.

### 4. Start

```bash
docker compose --env-file umami/card.env -f umami/docker-compose.yml up -d --wait
docker compose --env-file umami/card.env -f umami/docker-compose.yml ps
```

`--wait` returns when each service is running, and healthy when it has a healthcheck. Umami starts with the account `admin` and the password `umami`, and the `analytics` hostname will make its login page public. Change that password now, before Publish:

```bash
sh umami/prepare.sh
```

[prepare.sh](prepare.sh) is:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# Prepare for the umami starter: change the default password, admin / umami, before the login page is public.
# Run it after Start and before Publish, from the directory that holds umami/:
#   sh umami/prepare.sh
set -eu
cd "$(dirname "$0")"
set -a; . ./card.env; set +a
COMPOSE=${COMPOSE:-docker compose --env-file card.env -f docker-compose.yml}

B="http://127.0.0.1:$UMAMI_PORT"
H='Content-Type: application/json'
token=$(curl -fsS -X POST "$B/api/auth/login" -H "$H" -d '{"username":"admin","password":"umami"}' \
  | sed -n 's/.*"token":"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p')
curl -fsS -X POST "$B/api/me/password" -H "$H" -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" \
  -d "{\"currentPassword\":\"umami\",\"newPassword\":\"$UMAMI_ADMIN_PASSWORD\"}" >/dev/null
echo "admin's password is now UMAMI_ADMIN_PASSWORD"
```

It prints `admin's password is now UMAMI_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. Sign in as `admin` with that password.

### 5. Publish

```bash
set -euo pipefail
set -a
. umami/card.env
set +a
device_id=$(edgible device list --json | jq -er --arg name "$DEVICE" '
  map(select(.name == $name))
  | if length == 1 then .[0].id
    else error("need exactly one device named " + $name + " (" + (map(.status + " " + .id) | join(", ")) + ")")
    end
')
edgible app create existing \
  --non-interactive \
  --name umami \
  --port "$UMAMI_PORT" \
  --protocol https \
  --auth-modes org \
  --device-id "$device_id"
edgible app create existing \
  --non-interactive \
  --name analytics \
  --port "$UMAMI_PORT" \
  --protocol https \
  --auth-modes none \
  --device-id "$device_id"
edgible app list
```

## Verify

`umami` uses `org`.

```bash
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code} %{redirect_url}\n' "https://<umami hostname>"
```

That prints `302` and an `edgible.com/application-access/` address, so the org sign-in is in front. Open the hostname in a browser, sign in, then sign in to Umami with the password you set in Start.

`analytics` uses `none`.

```bash
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' "https://<analytics hostname>"
```

That prints `200`. Fetch `/script.js` on it to see the tracking script, with no login.

The rest of the setup is in the [Umami docs](https://umami.is/docs).

## Tear down

Four steps, in this order. Step 1 runs wherever `edgible` is logged in. Steps 2 to 4 run on the machine that runs the containers. Steps 2 and 3 read `card.env`, so keep it until step 4.

### 1. Unpublish

```bash
edgible app delete umami --yes
edgible app delete analytics --yes
```

### 2. Stop

```bash
docker compose --env-file umami/card.env -f umami/docker-compose.yml down
```

### 3. Delete the data

Skip this step to keep the data. The loop copies each volume to a `.tgz` file in this directory first.

```bash
for volume in $(docker volume ls -q --filter label=com.docker.compose.project=umami); do
  docker run --rm -v "$volume:/data:ro" -v "$PWD:/backup" alpine tar -czf "/backup/$volume.tgz" -C /data .
done
docker compose --env-file umami/card.env -f umami/docker-compose.yml down --volumes
```

### 4. Remove the starter

```bash
rm -rf umami
```
